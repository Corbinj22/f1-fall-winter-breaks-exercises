## Professional Practices: Write a Blog Post

## Instructions

Your task is to write a blog post about a technical concept you learned about in Mod 0 or Week 1 of Mod 1. You may be thinking "but I barely know anything!" or "So many people have written about the topics I've learned so far!". The first is not true, the second is true. The thing is, everyone makes sense of concepts in their own way. Even if there are 735 other blog posts about the topic you choose, you will be the first one to present it in the way you do! It's also a **GREAT** way to reinforce your own learning - it usually requires you to do some research test things out, and explain things in a concise and accurate way.

## Deliverable

Complete this challenge by posting your blog on **dev.to, medium, or your personal site**. Provide the link to your live post in your submission gist.
