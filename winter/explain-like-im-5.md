## Explain Like I'm 5

Explaining a complex subject simply is, weirdly, super difficult!

It requires you to really understand a concept - what's important, what's fundamental, what aspects depend on others ...

Your tasks is to pick one (1) small concept and attempt to explain it, clearly and thoroughly, to a non-developer!

A good rule of thumb: would a 5 year old understand you? Don't forget that 5 year olds are funny and sharp - don't talk down!

Your goal:

- Ensure that your ~victim~ friend understands the concept from a high level
- Be creative to communicate the concept in ways OTHER than through actual code
- Practice breaking down a concept in a way that is not condescending, but is accessible and fun

## Deliverable
