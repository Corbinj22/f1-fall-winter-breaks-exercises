## JavaScript DOM Challenges: Will Andy Pick Me?

## Instructions

Follow the setup directions in [this repo](https://github.com/turingschool/will-andy-pick-me). The iterations below are also in the README, as well as screenshots of the comp and a list of "possible answers".

Commit at the end of each iteration (if not more frequently) for good habits!

**Iteration 0:** Build Out Comp

- Images of comp below
- An assets directory is provided in the repo, and colors are provided in the CSS file
- Do _not_ spend time making this page responsive

**Iteration 1:** Add Random Message Functionality

- When a user types in a question then clicks the "Get your answer" button, the use sees their question and a random answer from the list of possible answers (a list of the possible random answers is provided below)
- The input field the user typed the question into should clear as soon as they click the "Get your answer" button
- When the question and answer appear, the image of the 8 ball disappears

**Iteration 2:** Clear Functionality, error checking
- The user can also click a clear button, which clears the page of any message. User should only be able to click the clear button if a question/answer are visible. When the clear button is clicked and the question/answer are removed, the image of the 8 ball should re-appear.
- User should not be able to ask for an answer unless they have typed something into the question box.

**Iteration 3:** Level Up

- *NOTE: You should absolutely not be working on this unless your UI is solid and you are 100% sure that all of Iterations 1-2 are fully functional and bug free.*
- Once user clicks and sees an answer, they can click a "favorite" button. That question and its answer should then be on a list of favorited question/answer pairs
- The user can favorite as many or as few question/answer pairs as they like
- When the user refreshes the page, all favorites will be gone
- No guidance is provided for the layout of this; use your best judgement and work to keep it consistent with the look and feel of what you built in Iteration 1!
