## Professional Practices: Prep for Coffee Meetings

## Instructions

Later during your time at Turing, part of your PD requirements will be setting up Coffee Meetings! These are common in the industry when shopping for jobs. It's a great way to meet developers, learn about their experiences at companies and how they got into the tech industry. Whether it leads directly to a job or not, it's a great way to learn and work your way outside the Turing bubble!

On thing students often say is "But I'm so nervous - what will we TALK about?!". Well, since you're requesting the meeting, you'll want to have some talking points and questions prepared.

Develop a list of 10-12 questions that you would want to ask a developer. It can be about them, their job, their company, etc.

## Deliverable

Provide the link to your list of questions in your submission gist.
